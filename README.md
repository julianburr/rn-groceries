**Groceries** is a React Native app, mainly build as a personal development playgound. I will also use it for demonstration purpose, branching tutorials, etc., if I find the time.

I will keep results and thoughts of my experimenting as markdowns in a separate `knowledge` folder...

## Playground

The following are things I want to play around with and explore a bit deeper.

 - [ ] Create a solid RN boilerplate to use for future projects
 - [x] Integrate Storybook for component development
 
 - [ ] Navigation header - find a good approach dealing with iOS and Android differences, dealing with shared NH between routes (?) and with giving the component the control over the `StatusBar`
 - [ ] List element *SwipeOut* - using horizontal `ScrollView`s in the `ListView`, or even better using `Animated.ScrollView`!
 - [ ] Routing - Finding a good structure to handle both routing and modals
